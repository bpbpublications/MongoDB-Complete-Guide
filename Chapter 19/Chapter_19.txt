/* Important Notes */

1.	We have shown the Sharding and Created the Replica Sets on the Same Machine only to make you understand Sharding in a Practical Manner so that it is easier for you to do it practically on your Machines.

2.	It is very important to note that in the real environment it is done on separate servers and each Replica Member is created on Separate Server Instance.

3.	Live and production enviorements have separate servers for every instance in the Replica Sets and instead of using "localhost" we use the "IP Address" of the Instances.
